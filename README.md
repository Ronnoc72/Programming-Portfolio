These are five gui applications made in pygame or tkinter. This is an assignment for a programming class, and these are some of the projects that we have done in class, and some that I have done on my own.

I am a programmer that enjoys using python and javascript, however these project are all made in python. My dream job would be to work as a software developer in a faang company. I love math and algarithums, those concepts make a lot of sense to me.
