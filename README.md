<p>I am a programmer that enjoys using python and javascript, however these project are all made in python. My dream job would be to work as a software developer in a faang company. I love math and algarithums, those concepts make a lot of sense to me. I love to try new things with my projects and jumping right into a technology is the best way for me to learn.</p>
